# Pixelo
A _feel-good_ drawing app built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).  
Designed and prototyped on [Figma](http://figma.com/). [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/lCLPsyu6JlaTSVDIoPpNwe/Pixelo?node-id=0%3A1)

Game deployed at [pixelo.juleshwar.dev](https://pixelo.juleshwar.dev)  

## Why?
I was inspired to make this game after watching a [Ember.js tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KrBuO0RRE) by Gavin Joyce a while back. I added it to my Notion list and forgot about it (as one does). I recently started learning React.js and wanted to build something. Enter ~~Pixlicate~~ **Pixelo**! (Apparently (pixel + duplicate =) "Pixlicate" doesn't roll off the tongue that easily).  
Fast-forward a month, we now have Pixelo up and running :)
